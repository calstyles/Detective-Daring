        <p style="font-size: 30pt; color:red;">I turned in my badge...I couldn't figure out this case, it was too hard. Shelly has been hanged for his crime, and I'm certain the culprit got away. It's all my fault. I was too slothful to see the truth. I'm a failure of a detective, and that's all there is to it.</p>
