        <p>Detective Daring: "Did anyone know you were at the house?"</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Shelly: "The only people that would have known is the Inventor and his girlfriend Kelley. She wasn't anywhere near the crime that night, but she knows all about how I'm sneaking into his house all the time! She knew all about the inventor, after all! Including me! I hope she's doing okay...dealing with his death and all..."</p>
