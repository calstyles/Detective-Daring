        <p>Detective Daring: "As you can see, the back of the trunk is all bloodied up. That is proof that when the car came in, the body was actually in the trunk the entire time! Which also explains why there was so little blood on the floor where we had thought the victim was stabbed."</p>

        <p>Kelley: "Oh yeah? Even if the murder came from the outside doesn't mean that it was me!"</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Detective Daring: "Oh ho ho, and this is where you are absolutely wrong, Miss Kelley. I have proof that shows you were there the night the murder had been committed."</p>
