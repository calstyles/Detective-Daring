        <p>Detective Daring: "There is a key in your lamp desk, no? How long have you had that key for?"</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Kelley: "A long time! A VERY long time. Hoooo it's getting hot in here hahaha..."</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Detective Daring: "Really? I doubt it. Mind if I borrow it? If my theory is wrong, then surely that isn't the key to the Inventor's safe, is it?"</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Kelley: ACK!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Detective Daring: *YES. I've got her now*</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Kelley: "HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA. SO THAT'S YOUR ENDGAME HUH? Bluffs can only take you so far, Detective Downer! If you're so certain that I stabbed my boyfriend, then where's your evidence? How did I go about it? Where's the murder weapon at now, huh? If you can't solve that, then you got nothing! HAHAHHAHAHAHAH!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Detective Daring: Well ya see, I have just the proof I need! The murder weapon itself is the key to all this, after all! So allow me to tell you where the weapon came from!</p>
