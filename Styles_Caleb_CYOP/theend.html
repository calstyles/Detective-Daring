        <h>And so, our story comes to an end. Kelley was found guilty on all accounts, and Shelly was set free to mourn the loss of his friend. The parents of the victim apologized for pressing charges against Shelly for murder, only to turn around and press him for charges of breaking and entering. I still have my detective badge, the parents earned a fortune with the invention (which had a bit of a bloodstain on it) and all was right with the world. I guess this is what they call a happy ending, huh? I should know. I'm a Daring Detective, after all.</h>
