        <p1>The victim was a 19 year old inventor who was working on developing some new kind of technology. The crime took place in this garage, and on the victim's body, the car keys had been found, indicating he had been out before he was murdered. No murder weapon has yet been found at the scene of the crime. The last person who was at the victim's house at the time the crime took place were his parents and friend, Shelly. Shelly had not been with the victim's parents at the time the crime took place, and Shelly claimed they never saw the victim. Not sure if I buy it, but I'll listen to what he has to say later.</p1>
