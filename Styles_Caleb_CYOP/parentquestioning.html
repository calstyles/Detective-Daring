        <h>The Night of the Murder</h>
    <p>Victim's Mother: "We had not seen the victim all night until we found the body in the garage. No one else was in the house except Shelly, our son's friend. We had no idea he was here, but he had to have been the one who snuck in and murdered our son. He was one of the people who knew about the camera system we have up front, where only someone who knew about it could've snuck past them at any time. Our son drove his car from his girlfriend's house, Kelley, and he had driven back into the garage, which we had saw on camera. When it seemed like it was taking too long for our son to come back, we found him a few minutes later and...I'm sorry...I can't speak any more of it. If only we could have stopped that so-called friend before it was too late..." </p>
    <p>Detective Daring: "Thank you for your time. We're going to get to the bottom of how this all happened right away."</p>
