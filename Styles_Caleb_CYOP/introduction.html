        <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:#505050; font-family: inherit;">You are Detective Daring, tasked with solving a murder involving 5 suspects.  
</p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:#505050; font-family: inherit;">In this game, you will be doing three things: Investigating, Interrogating and Solving the Mystery.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:palevioletred; font-family: inherit;">When you investigate, you gather important pieces of information that will help you solve the mystery. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:palevioletred; font-family: inherit;">When you interrogate, you will be given a plethora of questions to choose from, all different answers from the suspects. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:palevioletred; font-family: inherit;">When you attempt to solve the mystery, you acknowledge that you have looked over all the evidence and interrogated all the witnesses.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:#505050; font-family: inherit;">You will be given many hints along the way. Read closely because these will help you to identify the evidence you need to show or the person you need to accuse. If you choose the wrong answer when you attempt to solve the mystery, then Detective Daring will have failed the case and you will be required to turn in your badge.
</p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:forestgreen; font-family: inherit;">Fret not! </p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:forestgreen; font-family: inherit;">If you do fail the case, then you can move back a few steps to read more evidence and try again. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:#505050; font-family: inherit;">It is recommended that you explore everything from top to bottom, but if you feel like going out of order, then do as you please. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:#505050; font-family: inherit;">You will be given the chance to solve the mystery later on in this game, but if you need to go back through in case you may have missed something, then just go to the Travel Menu and go to the place you need to be. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:rebeccapurple; font-family: inherit;">At the start, you will be given multiple example links to click. These will get you accustomed to the format of the game and how the link structure works.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:rebeccapurple; font-family: inherit;">You are given one place to explore and then more will be revealed once you've explored that location. Alternatively, go straight to the Travel Menu to see everything else for yourself.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:darkgoldenrod; font-family: inherit;">The steps you want to take when going about this investigation are up to you, but don't say I didn't warn you that if you decide to take a short cut, well... you might well lose your badge.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:darkgoldenrod; font-family: inherit;">It is up to you to solve the riddles behind this case and expose the true culprit! </p>
    <p style="font-size: 40pt; color:darkgoldenrod; font-family: inherit;">Good luck detective!</p>
